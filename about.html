            <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1">
              <p>Bring Me A Book Franklin was launched as a volunteer effort in 2009 by Michaelin and Dave Watts and Marie Marshall, residents of Franklin County, Florida.</p>

              <p>Michaelin and Dave were inspired by the vision and dedicated work of their close friend, Judy Koch, founder of Bring Me A Book Foundation and by Brigid Hubberman of the Family Reading Partnership in Ithaca, NY.</p>

              <p>The project began as a plan for a small, church-based childcare center.  However, recognizing the need throughout the county the project quickly blossomed into an organization focused on serving all the young children of Franklin County.  Michaelin, Dave and Marie have brought their experiences as a clinical social worker, large corporate CEO, and early childhood educator, respectively, to the launching of this effort.</p>

              <p>Through a contractual license arrangement and with our shared mission, Judy Koch and her staff at Bring Me A Book Foundation have generously offered, on an ongoing basis, the benefits of their own experiences and valuable resources, brochures, book lists, literacy videos and training modules.</p>

              <h2>Why the Effort?</h2>

              <p>Research shows that 90% of human brain development occurs in the first five years of life, and that reading to a child during this developmental period is critical to building skills and foundation blocks on which future literacy and, therefore success in school, is based.</p>

              <p>In 1983, the U.S. Department of Education created its first Commission on Reading to explore the reading decline.  Its 1985 report (Becoming a Nation of Readers) included this findings: “The single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children”.  Jim Trelease, a noted author and lecturer on reading aloud to children writes: “We read aloud to children for the same reasons we talk to them: to reassure; entertain; bond; inform; arouse curiosity; and to inspire.  But reading aloud goes further than conversation when it: conditions the child to associate reading with pleasure; creates background knowledge; builds “book” vocabulary; and provides a reading role model.“ A child who is read to aloud during the pre-school years, for as little as 20 minutes a day, starts school two years ahead of a child who has not received such a benefit.</p>

              <h2>Why Franklin Count?</h2>

              <p>Franklin County, FL is a sparsely populated county of about 11,500 residents.  It is situated on the eastern end of the Florida panhandle on the Gulf of Mexico......on one of the longest stretch of white sand beaches in North America. The area has been called "Florida's Best Kept Secret" and the "Forgotten Coast".  With no high rises, Apalachicola still maintains many of its historic homes and charm. Working fleets of shrimp and oyster boats in the waters of Apalachicola, Eastpoint , Carrabelle, Alligator Point and St. George Island speak to the area's longstanding industry of seafood fishing and processing. Apalachicola oysters are a sought after delicacy.</p>

              <p>Apalachicola located at the mouth of the Apalachicola River is Franklin County's largest city with a population of 2700. It was a major cotton port at the time of the Civil War, even housing a French Consulate at that time. In recent decades a number of artists, writers and nature lovers have been drawn to the area's charm and beauty and have made it their home.</p>

              <p>In spite of significant tourism, behind the charm and beauty, Franklin County is plagued by economic distress and pervasive poverty.  Over 80% of the school children qualify for free school lunches.  The poverty rate for the state of Florida is 12% while the poverty rate for Franklin County stands at 19%. (U.S. Census, 2000)  Births to unwed mothers and births to teenagers in the county are significantly higher than the Florida State average.</p>

              <p>The level of education of the adult population is low with only 68% having a high school diploma, compared to the state average of 80%.  An average of 29% of Franklin County adults function at or below level one literacy, the lowest level of functional illiteracy characterized by adults who are not able to perform the activities of daily living that require basic math or reading skills.</p>
