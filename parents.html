              <p>As a parent, grandparent or caregiver you are in a position to greatly enhance your child's brain development and success in school. Reading Aloud to your child, beginning  at birth, just twenty minutes a day will make a difference! Your child loves to hear your voice and to have special time with you. Reading a book together with appealing illustrations helps the child associate good feelings with books and the written word. It's not about teaching your child how to read. It is about creating for your child, the " Want to Read."</p>

                    I’m tired.  Read just 1 book to your child – snuggle in and relax!
                    Older children can read to younger children
                    Play audio recording of a story

                    I don’t have quiet space. Read during meal times
                    Involve the entire family
                    Turn off the TV, radio, and computer
                    Take a book to the park or sit outside
                    Go for a walk, sing, and talk

                    My children are restless. Read to them while they are playing
                    Make games: finger plays, action songs
                    Read when they are sleepy, especially before nap & bedtime
                    Read a book your child can act out
                    Read a shorter book
                    I’m not comfortable reading in a way that holds my child’s attention. Start with a book on tape and make faces to help “tell” the story
                    Smile, frown, growl, and make animal sounds
                    Make a unique sound to signal the turning of the page
                    Use a high and low voice to match what’s happening in the book
                    My children have special needs. Use books with Braille for children with vision impairment.
                    Read adaptive learning books for children with learning disabilities 
                    Play an audio recording of a book for the learning or vision impaired
                    Read books made from materials for sensory stimulation
                    I have a disability that makes reading aloud difficult. Act out what the characters may be thinking or feeling
                    Make up a story that goes with the pictures and ask questions
                    Let your child tell the story, or let them guess what happens next.
                    Pretend to not understand the story and let your child be the “teacher”
                    Take turns describing each picture

              <h2>Second Grade Program: I Know I Can</h2>

              <p>BMAB Franklin recognizes that second grade is a critical year for developing reading proficiency.  With this awareness, BMAB Franklin partners with the second grades in both the Franklin Consolidated School and ABC (Charter) School with a program focused on inspiring second grade children to discover their personal resources and talents and develop their belief that they can do what it takes to go to college.</p>

              <p>This project is based on the children’s story and workbook, “I Know I Can” written by Andrea Dunn of Columbus, Ohio.</p>

              <p>The children present a play for their parents and families, underlining their belief in themselves.</p>

              <h2>Read Aloud Readers</h2>

              <p>BMAB Franklin recognizes that parents and caregivers have many demands on their time and energy.  In addition, many of the parents and caregivers do not have reading skills.</p>

              <p>With this in mind BMAB also trains older children, typically 5th graders to become Read Aloud Readers for the Pre-K and K children.  The fact that young children “look up” to older children as role models adds special meaning to the Read Alouds.  The program offers the added benefit of increasing the fluency and adding to the self-esteem of the older children.</p>

              <p>BMAB Franklin trainers do the initial training after which the school or agency coordinates and directs the ongoing program.  Read Aloud Reader programs are currently active at the ABC (Charter) School in Apalachicola and the Nest (after school program) in both Eastpoint and Carrabelle.</p>

              <p>Read Aloud Readers log their reading time and are given BMAB tee-shirts and business cards at important service milestones.</p>

              <p>In 2010, Carol Barfield of the Franklin County Library’s TIGERS/KITS program carried out an innovative program training older children to read to their younger siblings and their young friends.</p>

              <h2>Hispanic Outreach</h2>

              <p>There is a small Hispanic community in Franklin County.  BMAB Franklin is working to find ways to reach this community.  First steps have been made through the Catholic Church where quality children’s books were given out and parents were given the message of the importance of spending time with their children with books.  Many of the members of the Hispanic Community do not read or speak English or Spanish.  BMAB Franklin emphasizes the value of enjoying the illustrations together which fosters an interest and desire to learn to read.</p>

              <h2>Training Adult Volunteers</h2>

              <p>BMAB Franklin trains adults to become trainers for parents and older children.  Training sessions include the development of the knowledge base about the importance of Reading Aloud to children from birth and skills to impart that knowledge and enthusiasm to others through the use of brief talks, videos and experiential exercises.</p>
